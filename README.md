# AzureStorageUploader
Azure Storage allows you to host a static website by just uploading an index.html onto your container. 

However there is no functionality to easily upload a folder that contains all your js and media files like `./dist` which is generated by webpack. 

This python script will help upload all the necessary files needed to host your static website to your storage account.

1) You will need to run `pip install azure_storage_blob`.
2) Set env variable AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING={your_azure_storage_connection_string}
3) Navigate to directory that contains `dist` folder
4) Run the script
