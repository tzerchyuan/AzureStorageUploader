# AzureStorageUploader
Azure Storage allows you to host a static website by just uploading an index.html onto your container. There is no functionality to upload a folder that contains all your js and media files like `dist` which is generated by webpack. This python script will help upload all the necessary files needed to host your static website to your storage account.
